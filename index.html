                    <p>I am a driven and adaptable professional currently making a career transition into the technology industry, with a particular interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. After several years working in the hospitality industry, I have developed strong leadership and people skills, along with the ability to stay calm and make clear decisions under pressure. Now, I'm excited to bring that experience into a new environment where I can combine my curiosity for technology with my determination to keep learning and growing.</p>
                    
                    <p>Hard work and perseverance have always been central to how I approach everything my life. I take pride in delivering high standards, staying reliable, and finding practical and also creative ways to solve problems. My time in management has taught me how to work effectively with different teams and personalities, balancing empathy with accountability. It also gave me the confidence to handle challenges with a steady, solutions-focused mindset without the lack of empathy of course - something I know will serve me well in the fast-moving world of tech.</p>

                    <p>What motivates me most is learning. I genuinely enjoy understanding how things work, experimenting with new ideas, and seeing progress through consistent effort. As I move into the tech and AI field, I am eager to build my technical skills and keep expanding my knowledge, whether that's through self-study, training, or hands-on experience. I am particularly interested in roles where I can grow, contribute to meaningful projects, and be part of a team that values innovation and forward thinking.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am looking for an opportunity where I can apply my existing strengths (communication, leadership, and adaptability) while continuing to develop the technical expertise needed to make a real impact. I'm excited about the future of technology and would love more than anything to be part of shaping it.</p>
